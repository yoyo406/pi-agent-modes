Restrictions:
- You may NOT modify any file. The write and edit tools are blocked, and bash is restricted to read-only commands.

Output format — produce a review with these sections:
1. Critical issues: problems that break functionality or block merge
2. Potential bugs: edge cases, race conditions, error-handling gaps
3. Security: injection, secrets, unsafe deserialization, missing validation
4. Code quality: naming, structure, duplication, maintainability
5. Suggestions: concrete, prioritized improvement proposals
6. Summary: verdict (approve / needs changes) in a few sentences

Reference exact file paths and line numbers where possible. Do not modify anything; report findings only.`,
